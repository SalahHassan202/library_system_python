## 🧪 How It Works

🔸 All data is stored in 3 separate files:
- `Books.txt` – holds book titles and copy count
- `Customers.txt` – holds customer IDs and names
- `Circulations.txt` – tracks borrow/return actions

🔸 Users interact with a simple menu:
> 1 - Add New Book  
> 2 - Add New Customer  
> 3 - Borrow Book  
> 4 - Return Book  
> 5 - Exit

Each option runs a clean, validated function to get the job done 💯
